excerpt: "The purpose of the ODAP is to facilitate biomedical research to advance understanding of disease caused by emerging or re-emerging pathogens.
<br />
<br />
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK generated several unique research data assets that have enabled critical discoveries and have shaped the COVID-19 response in the UK and around the world. ODAP is now in the process of unifying these data assets along with human and viral genomes within the ODAP trusted research environment (TRE). Beyond COVID-19 the ODAP will focus on emerging or re-emerging infectious agents, therapy-resistant forms of existing infectious agents or other exposures of public health interest.
<br />
<br />
Within the ODAP TRE we promote further vital research and create the oppertunity for further critical discoveries by creating additional data linkages, automating data flows and analyses, and by democratising access to UK research datasets."

## Scope
The purpose of the ODAP is to facilitate biomedical research to advance understanding of disease caused by emerging or re-emerging pathogens (new infectious agents, and new, re-emerging or therapy-resistant forms of existing infectious agents) or other exposures (new or unexplained poisoning, or exposure to harmful energy sources such as electromagnetic radiation) of public health interest. Research within the ODAP is strictly limited to this purpose.

### The Platform
Our UKRI-supported [platform](/platform/) based at the University of Edinburgh is a trusted research environment (TRE) running on a high-performance computing space that holds data securely allowing academic and public health researchers access following a ‘five safes’ (http://www.fivesafes.org) research application and governance process.  

Once granted access for a defined research project researchers can then make use of multiple datasets in the ODAP, handling sensitive data in the trusted research environment where it can be analysed along with non-sensitive data such as human and viral genomes. 

Further information is available on our [platform](/platform/) page. 

### During COVID-19
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK has generated several globally unique research data assets that have enabled critical discoveries which have shaped the COVID-19 response in the UK and globally. Examples of these data assets include sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, sequencing of the DNA of patients with severe COVID-19 in intensive care, and the systematic capture of detailed clinical record information. While each of these data sets alone have generated transformational knowledge - conducting joint analysis of multiple data sets has the potential to yield further significant discoveries.  

The ODAP holds unique aggregation of UK sovereign data assets, including the complete data resources of the ISARIC4C/CO-CIN (clinical characterisation of COVID-19 patients), GenOMICC (host genetics of severe COVID-19 patients), PHOSP (follow up of COVID-19 patients), HEAL COVID (trial), and UK-CIC (immunology of COVID-19 patients) studies, together with COG-UK (SARS-CoV-2 viral sequence from ~15% of all cases) data from England and Scotland, and linkage to the RECOVERY trial, NHS clinical records, national vaccination records, critical care audit data (SICSAG) and mortality records. Linkage to ICNARC CMP has already been agreed. 

The ODAP partnership aims to facilitate vital research on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 genetic and phenotypic variation on disease severity and vaccine efficacy by creating additional data linkages, automating data flows and analyses, and democratising access to research datasets with full agreement from the contributing studies. ODAP partnership is an overarching grouping of UK data generators and provides oversight, strategic guidance and governance to the ODAP platform.

## For the Public
UK science has been at the forefront of the scientific endeavours to understand the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to find better ways to treat and prevent COVID-19 disease.  

Important UK based research studies have generated critical scientific data that has enabled scientists and doctors to make important discoveries including: 

1. Tracking the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses by sequencing the ‘DNA’ of the virus. This has been done for more than a million COVID-19 cases – and enable scientists to identify emergence and spread of ‘variants’ such as the Alpha, Delta and now Omicron variant.  

2. Understanding COVID-19 disease and then assessing the effects of variants and vaccination on disease severity. This is done by doctors and nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals across making detailed records of the clinical characterisation of COVID-19 disease (e.g. patients condition, treatments, progression)  

3. Understanding how differences in people’s DNA can affect if they will develop severe COVID-19 disease. This was done by sequencing the DNA of people who were in intensive care with severe COVID-19 disease. This has identified 23 differences in our DNA that can lead to greater severity, scientists will now use this understanding to develop new treatments for COVID-19. 

The findings made by analysing the data from these three studies have all alone brought benefits to public health and patients, including being used by government to help manage the pandemic. 

The Outbreak data analysis platform (ODAP) partnership has now been set up by scientists across the UK to bring together the data from these three studies (and others) in a single secure and powerful computer system that will allow scientists to analyse the together all together for the first time.  

The data will be held securely and anonymously, and access will be restricted to only accredited scientists who will be able to access and use the data – after going through a ‘five safes’ (URL) application process. 

The joined-up nature of health care data in the UK National Health Service (NHS) makes the UK one of the very few places in the world were this can be done in big enough numbers to make new discoveries possible. It offers the opportunity for scientists to make new discoveries to help treat COVID-19 patients and to improve the pandemic response.  

For the long term - being able to analysis different types of pandemic health care data rapidly in a single location will enable the UK to be better prepared for future pandemics and to routinely conduct infectious disease research (e.g. flu, sepsis and antibiotic resistant bacteria (aka ‘Superbugs’).
