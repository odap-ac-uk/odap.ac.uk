## The global GenOMICC Study

The Genetics Of Mortality in Critical Care (GenOMICC) study ([genomicc.org](https://genomicc.org)) discovered the first genetic signal ever to lead directly to a new drug treatment for infectious disease or critical illness. Our report in Nature in 2020 led directly to the RECOVERY trial of baricitinib, which was shown to be an effective treatment for Covid-19.
