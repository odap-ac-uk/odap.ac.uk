<p>ODAP holds unique and growing aggregation of UK sovereign data assets. Over time we aim to include more assets to incurage further research into the emerging and re-emerging pathogens or exposures of public health interest. The most up-to-date list of available data-sets is available on on the <a href="https://www.healthdatagateway.org/">HDR Gateway</a> and more detailed data dictionary on the <a href="https://github.com/isaric4c/wiki">ODAP Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>The following key data sets are available: <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>ISARIC4C/CO-CIN - clinical measurements and characterisation of COVID-19 patients</li>
  <li>GenOMICC â€“ whole genome sequencing and genotyping of severe and mild COVID-19 patients</li>
  <li>PHOSP â€“ long term follow up of COVID-19 patients)</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information is available on the <a href="https://www.healthdatagateway.org/">HDR Gateway</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/isaric4c/wiki">ODAP Wiki</a>.</p>
