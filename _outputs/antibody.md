Accurate and sensitive detection of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 remains an essential component of the pandemic response. 
Measuring antibody that predicts neutralising activity and the vaccine response is an absolute requirement for laboratory-based confirmatory and reference activity.
The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) constitutes the prime target antigen for neutralising antibody. A hybrid double antigen binding assay (DABA) for anti-RBD showed a specificity of 100 % on 825 pre COVID-19 samples and a potential sensitivity of 99.6 % on 276 recovery samples, predicting quantitatively the presence of neutralising antibody determined by pseudo-type neutralization and by plaque reduction.
