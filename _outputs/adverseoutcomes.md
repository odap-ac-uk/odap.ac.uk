Characterisation of 75 463 hospitalised COVID-19 patients from 258
participating health-care facilities showed that underlying respiratory
symptoms is common and patients with asthma were more likely, and those
with chronic pulmonary disease less likely, to receive critical care
than patients without an underlying respiratory condition**.**
